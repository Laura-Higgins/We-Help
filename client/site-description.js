      Since 2017 We-Help has connected no-where near 1 million helpers with those in need.
      Nonprofits can post Help Needed ads in an organized, easy-to-find, and convenient forum to
      quickly be connected to Helpers in their area. If you are a student looking for service credits, a community
      member with time to donate, or someone needing to fulfill legal service hours We-Help will get you
      connected to where the Need is!
